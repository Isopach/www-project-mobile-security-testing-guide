## Why Sponsor?

As it turns out, writing a book to a professional standard is a challenging task, even more so if there are 75+ authors that aren't necessarily native speakers. Also, professional editors and graphic designers don't work for free. Thus, some funds are needed to make sure we can publish a quality tech book.

100% of the funds raised go directly into the project budget and will be used to fund production of the final release, including:

- Editing and proofreading by professional editors.
- Graphic design and layout improvements.
- Acquiring new test devices if certain tests can not be executed on existing emulators/simulators/test devices.

Money left over will be saved for future rounds of editing.
